# electrum-go Server Configuration
# ================================
# This configuration file controls all aspects of the Electrum server.
# Copy this file to config.toml and modify as needed.

[server]
# Address and port to listen for Electrum client connections.
# Use "127.0.0.1:50001" for local-only access (recommended for testing).
# Use "0.0.0.0:50001" to accept connections from any interface (requires TLS in production).
listen = "127.0.0.1:50001"

# Maximum number of concurrent client connections.
# Each connection uses memory for buffers and subscription tracking.
# Adjust based on available RAM (estimate ~1MB per connection worst case).
max_connections = 100

# Request timeout for client operations (in seconds).
# Clients that don't send data within this period are disconnected.
request_timeout_seconds = 1700

[bitcoin]
# Bitcoin Core RPC connection settings (TESTNET4).

[storage]
# Path to the Pebble database directory.
# This directory will be created if it doesn't exist.

# Maximum reorg depth to keep undo logs for.
# 144 blocks ≈ 1 day on mainnet.
max_reorg_depth = 144

[indexer]
# Block height to start indexing from.
# -1 = Start from current chain tip (forward-indexing mode, recommended)
#  h = Start from specific height

# How often to save checkpoints during initial sync (in blocks).

# How often to clean up old undo logs (in blocks).
